To be fair, 
you have to have 
a very high IQ 
to play Celeste. 
The mechanics are 
extremely subtle, 
and without 
a solid grasp of 
theoretical physics 
most of the platforming 
will go over a typical 
player's head. 
There's also 
Down+Diagonal 
jump-dash reset, 
which 
is deftly 
woven into 
precise 
speedrunning 
movement, 
for instance. 
The players 
understand this stuff; 
they have the
intellectual capacity 
to 
truly 
appreciate 
the depths of these mechanics, 
to realise that they're not 
just precise 
and fast - 
they say something deep 
about LIFE. 
As a consequence 
people who think it's
fine 
for Celeste to be in 
2nd best 
indie game 
truly ARE idiots - 
of course they 
wouldn't appreciate, 
for instance, 
the joy of bypassing 
difficult sessions 
of the game 
abusing unintended mechanics,
which itself is a 
cryptic reference to 
how you make your own fate. 
I'm smirking right now 
just imagining 
one of those 
addlepated simpletons 
scratching their heads in confusion 
as they watch a speedrunner's 
genius wit 
unfolds itself 
on their monitor screens. 
What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, 
i DO have a Strawberry tattoo. 
And no, you cannot see it. 
It's for the ladies' eyes only - 
and even then they have to demonstrate
that they're within 5 IQ points of my own 
(preferably lower) 
beforehand. 
Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž
