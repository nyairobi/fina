3 centimeters
It’s a rule we can overlook (Woo!)
My sailor uniform
It’s lucky so I’m off the hook (Hey!)

Hypocrite – Just do it!
Pull back and release it – YEAH!
No sweat! (WOO!) No sweat! (WOO!)
You got it going – darlin’ darlin’ freeze!

Feeling kinda lazy
Borderlinein’ crazy
Wait no - I think maybe I love you!

Worry wart – no – wait - Introvert – Miss food court
HEY – just cut it out!

I don’t get what’s cool ‘bout the new girl
But she’s loved like the last in the whole world

Is it just me?
She’s just a school-girl!
Can I get seconds please? Right n-n-now!

POM POM CHEERLEADER
LET’S GET CHERRY PIE
LA LA welcome home
Party SENSATION (YEAH!)
Brilliant confidence
Look out! Shooting star
Take it away, squad ranger
Sing your heart out with us as we
Sing and Dance!

Take it all and be on the attack
I’ll be the one that will have the last laugh
And I’ll rock my sailor uniform like no big deal
I’m at a loss - I don’t know what to do
It’s Monday, so I’m in a bad mood
But at least my sailor uniform is super cute!

3 different pieces
And no time to overthink
Hey! Just do it (yeah!)
You’ll kill it! (yay!)
My Darlin Darlin, please!

Love makin’ me blur
Like a rollercoaster
Wait no – Can we keep that a secret?

Look at you fight back, like that
Spoiled brat - Red flag!
You better cut it out!

You’re my height now
So get a good look
Your pinky’s no match
For the heel of my foot

Now I’m in control, and hey I’m on a roll
From the hem of my skirt to my soul

MON-MON delusion
LET’S GO back in time
YAI-YAI soarin’ moves
WHAT’S UP? TEMPTATION (hey!)
Need a part time job
‘Cause I’m broke as heck
I’m gonna be set for life
So just sit back and watch as I SING AND DANCE

Give it a try
And give it all you got
The challenge you now face needs your best shot
Underneath my sailor uniform I am still me
The weekend’s here but what’s thhhere to
Do But show off whenever I’m near you
With a simple sailor uniform, life sure is great!

3 meter record
I’m holdin on for dear life (GYU)
Make my heart race
When we embrace
I’M SUGAR SUGAR SWEEeeeT ~

BON-BON MON-MON DAY
LET’S GET OO OO AH!
RAN-RAN CHOP CHOP KICK!

Learning’s so easy! Love is ABC
I fall in love - I fall in love

Take it all and be on the attack
I’ll be the one that will have the last laugh
And I’ll rock my sailor uniform like no big deal
I’m at a loss - I don’t know what to do
It’s Monday, so I’m in a bad mood
But at least my sailor uniform is super cute!

So naturally, I’ll be on the attack
I’ll be the one that will have the last laugh
And I’ll rock my sailor uniform like no big deal

3 centimeters
